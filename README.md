# Times, a protocol.

**Times** is a set of protocols for recording business events. It acts as a framework for merging existing approaches to record creation and storage, while also serving as the reference for developing new techniques and tools ('business machines').

Our starting point for record creation is the concept "TAOO", which stands for Time, Action, Object, Occurrence. In program form, it looks like this:&#x20;

```
Time(Action+Object+Occurence)
```
